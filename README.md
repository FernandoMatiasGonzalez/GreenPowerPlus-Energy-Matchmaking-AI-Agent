# GP+ | AI-Powered Clean Energy Matchmaking (Prototype)

This is a public-facing prototype for the **Green Power Plus (GP+)** platform. **GP+** leverages AI to transform B2B access to clean energy components, projects and financing.

---

### Project Overview

**GP+** is a rule-based AI agent that interprets natural language queries, extracts structured parameters, and dynamically matches users with clean energy vendors within a scalable, AI-assisted framework. It leverages predefined logic and an LLM-powered engine to process user input and return tailored results based on **capacity, financing, certifications, battery storage, location**, and **installation timeline**.

The system establishes the foundation for future **learning agents**, by structuring user interactions, vendor data, and decision logic for dynamic adaptation and reinforcement.

### Key Features (Prototype Phase)

- Natural language input (LLM-powered)
- Structured data extraction
- Vendor matching based on rule logic
- React-based user interface with Tailwind CSS
- Flask backend with PostgreSQL

---

### Project Structure

- `frontend/` â€“ Simplified React UI for user input and results  
- `backend/` â€“ Flask API that handles query parsing and rule-based matching  
- `docs/` â€“ Visual materials or diagrams for demo/pitch purposes

ðŸ’¡ Example queries:
- "8 kW in Veneto"
- "I need photovoltaics in Veneto, with battery storage"
- "150 kW PV in Lombardy with financing"
- "Solar panels in Tuscany with IEC 61215 certification"

ðŸ§¾ **Output**:

The system returns the three most competitive quotes, along with a tailored comparison dashboard to support decision-making.

### Disclaimer

This is a simplified version for demonstration purposes. Some logic and components have been abstracted for confidentiality.
